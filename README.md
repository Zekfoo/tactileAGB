# Background

(WORK IN PROGRESS, STILL IN TESTING)


This mod for the Game Boy Advance (AGB) was inspired by makho's [AGB_TACT](https://github.com/makhowastaken/AGB_TACT) project which added tactile buttons to the AGB similar to those on the GBA SP.

Developed from the ground up, this implementation offers a no-wires-required solution, consisting of 2 (or 3) flex breakout boards for the DPAD, AB, and (optionally) START and SELECT.

# Mod Options and Compatibility

The tactile buttons are available in two different actuation forces (listed below) - 1.6N or 2.35N/2.6N - to suit your particular feel.

This mod is only compatible with AGB-001.
